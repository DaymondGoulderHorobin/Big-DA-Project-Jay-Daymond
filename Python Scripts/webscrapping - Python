This was failed, but as we tried it so including within this project



from urllib.request import urlopen as uReq
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as soup
my_url = 'https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news'

#grabbing page content

uClient = uReq(my_url)
page_html = uClient.read()
uClient.close()
#html parser
page_soup = soup(page_html, "html.parser")
page_soup.title

#grabs rows
dataset = page_soup.findAll("tr",{"class":"TableBody-kSbjpE jGqIxa"})
